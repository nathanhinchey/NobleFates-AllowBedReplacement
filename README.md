# Allow Bed Replacement

## A [Noble Fates](https://noblefates.com) Mod

Now your noble won't think you're taking away their Chateau when you were
actually trying to upgrade their bed!

Have you had that thing happen where you have a beautiful bedroom but it's got
a straw bed, so you try to replace it with a wood bed but then that makes the
room a Bunk Room instead of a bedroom and suddenly your Chateau isn't even a
cabin anymore?

This is a small tweak to the definition of a Bunk Room. Before, if there were
two Included* Beds (instead of being specifically assigned to
someone), that would count as a bunk room. With this mod, there have to be
three included beds, or two Unincluded beds.

The intention of this mod is for replacing beds, but it also has the side
effect that if you want to have a guest bed in your room, or give a bed in your
room to the serf you make clean it, you can!

*Included means it's included in the room -- it's not assigned to someone specifically, it just belongs to whoever the room belongs to.
